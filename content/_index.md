Hi!

I work at the interface of applied machine learning, high-performance computing and particle physics.

I'm currently a Senior Research Scientist at the [Laboratory of High-Energy and Computational Physics](https://kbfi.ee/high-energy-and-computational-physics/?lang=en) at [NICPB](https://www.kbfi.ee), a national lab for fundamental and applied research in Estonia. My work has been funded by the [Estonian Research Council](https://etag.ee/en/). 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Caltech in the group of [Professor Spiropulu](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/maria-spiropulu), and prior to that, a PhD student at ETH Zurich in the group of [Professor Dissertori](https://dissertori-group.ethz.ch/). I did my undergraduate studies in physics at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee/en). 

I've also worked with a few companies: [GScan](https://www.gscan.eu/technology), [Lingvist](https://lingvist.io/blog/is-there-a-map-for-learning-a-language/).

Interested in working together? [Contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joosep-pata/)!
