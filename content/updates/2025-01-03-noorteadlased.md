I gave a presentation at the young scientists forum at the Estonian Young Academy of Sciences.

This is an interdisciplinary conference that is organized to bring together researchers from Estonia who are currently working abroad, or who have spent significant parts of their career abroad and returned to establish a research group in Estonia.

I spoke about the use of AI as a tool for discovery in fundamental sciences, and my experience of returing to Estonia after a PhD at ETH and postdoc at Caltech.
