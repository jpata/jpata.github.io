Tau lepton identification can be addressed efficiently with transformers, significantly outperforming the so-far best algo that uses a hybrid combinatorial + deep learning algorithm.

We used a highly granular simulation, which will now allow us to work towards a complete deep learning based tau reconstruction toolchain for current and future experiments.
