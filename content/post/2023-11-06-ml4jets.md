It's good to be at the ML4Jets workshop at DESY, with awesome talks & organization!

I gave a [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1253794/contributions/5588555/) on the recent progress in machine learning for particle flow reconstruction, applicable to current and future detectors at the CERN LHC and beyond!

HPC-friendly ML models for detector reconstruction are progressing, stay tuned!
