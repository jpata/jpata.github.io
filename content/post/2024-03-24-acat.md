I gave a plenary [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1330797/contributions/5776140/) on new ML-based reconstruction workflows for colliders at the [Advanced Computing and Analysis Tools (ACAT) 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1330797/) workshop at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), coorganized by [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov/world/).

This was based on a collaboration with [Professor Javier Duarte](https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/) from UCSD Department of Physics and [Maria Girone](https://openlab.cern/about/our-people/maria-girone) from [CoE RAISE](https://www.coe-raise.eu/).

Thanks to the [Estonian Research Council](https://etag.ee/en/) for funding ['Flexible and scalable data reconstruction and analysis using machine learning' (PSG864)](https://www.etis.ee/portal/projects/display/7287c942-e035-4cfc-823f-06e3567285f1)!
